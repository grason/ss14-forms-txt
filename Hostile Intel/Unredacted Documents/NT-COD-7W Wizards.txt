[color=#7646b3][bold]TEMPORARY CLEARANCE – NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS[/bold]
[bold]Directive: Wizard-Class Reality Distortion Threat Advisory[/bold]
────────────────────────────────────[/color]

To Station Command Authority,

This document is classified under Clause 7-C of the [bold]Corporate Secrets Mandate[/bold], effective immediately upon retrieval. It supersedes standard protocol regarding disclosure, interdepartmental transparency, and ethical containment.

Confirmation has been received of a [color=#7646b3]Wizard[/color]-class anomalous entity presently active aboard your station. Clearance is hereby extended to acting command and security personnel under emergency authority.

[bold]INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY:[/bold]
[bullet]Wizard-class threats manifest as humanoid entities utilizing advanced metaphysical and quantum-disruptive phenomena, referred to in colloquial terms as “magic.”
[bullet]Origins are unclear. Prior engagements suggest transit via bluespace rift, thaumaturgic gate, or direct spacetime manipulation.
[bullet]Entities frequently employ scrolls, staffs, and spoken incantations with variable tactical effects.
[bullet]No reliable biometric, psychological, or technological profile has been established.

[bold]CAPABILITIES:[/bold]
[bullet]Instantaneous displacement (teleportation), elemental projection, localized time dilation, and mass polymorphism.
[bullet]Potential for catastrophic sabotage, including AI shutdown, station-wide chaos, or transmutation of crew and systems.
[bullet]Confirmed incidents of temporary immortality, mind control, and ecosystem-level environmental alteration.

[bold]THREAT INDICATORS:[/bold]
[bullet]Unauthorized arrivals via space, chapel, or sudden corridor anomalies.
[bullet]Unusual wardrobe, glowing objects, incantation-like speech, or paradoxical resistance to conventional harm.
[bullet]Rapid destabilization of atmospherics, electrical grid, or crew cognition in proximity to suspect.

[bold]RESPONSE PROTOCOLS:[/bold]
[bullet]Do not engage alone. Isolate and delay target until containment teams can be formed.
[bullet]Deploy heavy weaponry, EMP grenades, anti-magic fields (if available), and ion-based munitions.
[bullet]Restrict AI access and door controls—wizard-class hostiles may exert anomalous override authority.
[bullet]Detain and interrogate any personnel claiming “magical abilities” or demonstrating rapid biological alterations.

[color=#7646b3][bold]WIZARD-CLASS REALITY THREATS ARE TO BE TREATED AS BREACHES OF ONTOLOGICAL SECURITY.
FAILURE TO CONTAIN WILL RESULT IN STATION DESTRUCTION UNDER FAILSAFE PROTOCOL 9-K.[/bold][/color]
