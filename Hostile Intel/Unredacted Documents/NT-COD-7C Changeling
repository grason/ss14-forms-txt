[color=#3139b3][bold]TEMPORARY CLEARANCE – NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS[/bold]
[bold]Directive: Changeling-Class Hostile Entity Disclosure[/bold]
────────────────────────────────────[/color]

To Station Command Authority,

This document is classified under Clause 7-C of the [bold]Corporate Secrets Mandate[/bold], effective immediately upon retrieval. It supersedes standard protocol regarding disclosure, interdepartmental transparency, and ethical containment.

Confirmation has been received of a [color=#3139b3]Changeling[/color]-class non-terrestrial hostile presently active aboard your station. Clearance is hereby extended to acting command and security personnel under emergency authority.

[bold]INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY:[/bold]
[bullet][color=#3139b3]Changeling entities[/color] exhibit full biometric mimicry, including vocal, retinal, and memory-level replication of human personnel.
[bullet]Independent of central syndicate command, though observed in related incidents.
[bullet]Purpose remains undetermined. Behavioral patterns suggest adaptive infiltration, likely oriented toward survival, study, or latent hive functionality.
[bullet]Detection is nontrivial. Biochemical anomalies and behavioral drift are primary indicators.

[bold]THREAT ASSESSMENT:[/bold]
[bullet]Personnel substitution without traceable death or disappearance.
[bullet]Extreme regenerative capability; conventional injury insufficient for neutralization.
[bullet]Capable of producing biological weaponry and generating field-level interference.
[bullet]Civilian awareness risks cascade failure in containment efforts.

[bold]RESPONSE DIRECTIVES:[/bold]
[bullet]Do not disseminate this document beyond command.
[bullet]Initiate controlled medical and security sweeps under false pretenses.
[bullet]Isolate individuals demonstrating cognitive drift, aberrant resilience, or inexplicable trauma recovery.
[bullet]Authorize termination via disintegration or incineration only—standard arms are insufficient.
────────────
[color=#1C3E91][bold]ANY UNAUTHORIZED PROPAGATION OF THIS DOCUMENT OR ITS CONTENTS IS CONSIDERED CORPORATE TREASON.
VIOLATORS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY RETIRED VIA CLAUSE 2-B, WITH NO RIGHT TO APPEAL.[/bold][/color]
