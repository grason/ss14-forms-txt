[color=#b31c1c][bold]TEMPORARY CLEARANCE – NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS[/bold]
[bold]Directive: Nuclear-Class Operative Deployment Alert[/bold]
────────────────────────────────────[/color]

To Station Command Authority,

This document is classified under Clause 7-N of the [bold]Corporate Secrets Mandate[/bold]. Disclosure is authorized strictly under preemptive engagement scenarios involving confirmed or imminent contact with syndicate-aligned [color=#3139b3]Nuclear-Class Operatives[/color].

Confirmation has been received of a [color=#b31c1c]Nuclear Operative[/color]-class hostile infiltration force presently active aboard your station. Clearance is hereby extended to acting command and security personnel under emergency authority.

[bold]INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY:[/bold]
[bullet][color=#3139b3]Nuclear Operatives[/color] are elite paramilitary agents deployed by hostile syndicate assets with the intent to destroy NanoTrasen property via atomic detonation.
[bullet]Deploy in small units via capsule dropship, often disguised until arrival.
[bullet]Extremely well-armed with illegal energy weapons, modified explosives, and prohibited cybernetic enhancements.
[bullet]Command structure is decentralized; operatives act with lethal autonomy.

[bold]THREAT ASSESSMENT:[/bold]
[bullet]Direct threat to station integrity and crew survival.
[bullet]In possession of an armed, unauthorized nuclear warhead (designated [bold]Theta-9[/bold]).
[bullet]Will attempt to reach or breach the station’s nuclear authentication terminal.
[bullet]Civilians are considered collateral by all sides. No hostages should be assumed recoverable.

[bold]COUNTERMEASURES PROTOCOL DESIGNATION: 7N-RHO-OBLIVION[/bold]
[bullet]Immediately seal and reinforce all access points to the AI core, bridge, and nuclear terminal.
[bullet]Engineer tactical chokepoints. Weaponize environment where possible.
[bullet]Do not engage alone. Squad tactics and brute firepower are required.
[bullet]If the nuclear device is activated, a failsafe transmission code ([bold]Ragnar Lock[/bold]) is stored in the NTR’s emergency vault.
[bullet]Under no circumstances may the device be allowed to detonate within habitable NanoTrasen territory.
