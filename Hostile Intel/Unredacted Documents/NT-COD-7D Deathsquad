[head=2]NanoTrasen Confidential Document 7-D[/head]

[bold]Author: Cassian Hawker, NIA Director[/bold]
────────────────────────────────────
[color=#2B3A42][bold]EMERGENCY CLEARANCE – PROTOCOL XG-Ω[/bold]
[bold]Directive: Final Corporate Enforcement – Deathsquad Deployment Authorized[/bold]
────────────────────────────────────[/color]

To Station Command,

This document is classified under Clause 7 of the [bold]Corporate Secrets Mandate[/bold], effective immediately upon retrieval. It supersedes all command authority, security hierarchy, and emergency autonomy protocols. If this document has reached you, you are no longer in control.

Confirmation has been received of a [color=#2B3A42]Deathsquad[/color]-class black ops response team en route or presently active within your operational perimeter. These operatives report directly to NanoTrasen High Command and are governed by Directive XG-Ω — total asset sterilization.

[bold]DEPLOYMENT CONDITIONS:[/bold]
[bullet]Authorization is issued only under conditions of absolute operational failure, wherein no viable path to station recovery remains.
[bullet]All on-site personnel are to be considered compromised, non-essential, or irreparably obstructive to strategic objectives.
[bullet]Standard chain of command is dissolved upon task force arrival; all authority is transferred to Corporate Oversight Command.
[bullet]Engagement protocols permit unrestricted use of force. Differentiation between hostile and non-hostile subjects is no longer a priority.
[bullet]Residual station infrastructure may be subjected to controlled demolition or post-evacuation sterilization if deemed necessary.

[bold]OPERATIVE PROFILE:[/bold]
[bullet]Designated as “Asset Black,” Deathsquad operatives are deployed under Directive Z-9 as autonomous denial agents.
[bullet]Drawn from off-ledger combat divisions, units operate with no identification, rank, or individual record.
[bullet]Biologically hardened and cognitively screened for mission inflexibility, these agents exhibit no empathy, hesitation, or internal conflict.
[bullet]Orders are executed with machine-level precision; deviation from protocol is statistically nonexistent.
[bullet]Engagement profile is total liquidation of on-site resistance, sabotage of recovery systems, and demolition of strategic assets.

[bold]STATION SURVIVAL ODDS:[/bold]
[bullet]Negligible. Containment is no longer a corporate objective.
[bullet]Evacuation is disallowed without High Command override.
[bullet]Communication blackout protocols are active.
[bullet]You may be a target.

[color=#7f0e0e][bold]YOU ARE ADVISED TO AWAIT DEATH WITH DIGNITY.[/bold]
[bold]DO NOT ENGAGE DEATHSQUAD OPERATIVES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.[/bold][/color]

────────────
[color=#1C3E91][bold]ANY ATTEMPT TO EVADE, WARN, OR RESIST THIS MANDATE WILL RESULT IN ONSITE TERMINATION VIA DIRECTIVE 0-ECHO.
THIS IS NOT A DRILL. THIS IS YOUR FINAL NOTICE.[/bold][/color]
